When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Gives the same product with chlorine. Can react explosively with isocyanates under basic conditions. The presence of an inert solvent mitigates this reaction [Wischmeyer 1969]. A violent exothermic reaction occurred between methyl alcohol and bromine in a mixing cylinder [MCA Case History 1863. 1972]. A flask of anhydrous lead perchlorate dissolved in methanol exploded when it was disturbed [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 52:2391. 1930]. P4O6 reacts violently with methanol. (Thorpe, T. E. et al., J. Chem.

They neutralize acids to form salts plus water. These acid-base reactions are exothermic. The amount of heat that is evolved per mole of amine in a neutralization is largely independent of the strength of the amine as a base. Amines may be incompatible with isocyanates, halogenated organics, peroxides, phenols (acidic), epoxides, anhydrides, and acid halides. Flammable gaseous hydrogen is generated by amines in combination with strong reducing agents, such as hydrides.",

Following the dreadful accident, Seibert remembers remarking that the explosion must have been caused by wet methanol and warns about the dangers of adding sodium azide to wet methanol.  Because no further details about the contents of the reactor are given, there is nothing I can say about it but to clarify that NaN3 does not form explosive compounds when dissolved in water. Besides its toxicity, the danger associated with NaN3 is its ability to form explosive azides when reacted with heavy metals such as lead, copper, zinc, cadmium, or nickel.\" (reprint of the full-text)",

                      "String": "\"Chemists at Merck & Co. were performing experiments using nitric oxide at high pressure (10\u201320 bar) when two instances of an explosion occurred during rapid depressurization of the NO headspace from a 500-mL closed reactor system. No injuries occurred, and damage was contained to the barricaded cell area. Both before and in between these events, NO had been used successfully about 100 times. Each explosion occurred after completion of the reaction, while venting through three-eighths- or one-quarter-inch i.d. Teflon-lined steel-braided tubing to atmospheric pressure.  Static electricity was suspected as the ignition source that, in conjunction with the presence of an oxidant (NO) and fuel (CH3OH), would lead to combustion. To confirm this hypothesis, an investigation was conducted. Preliminary results are communicated here.  The reaction system consisted of NO in conjunction with methanol under basic conditions. A literature search didn\u2019t point to any existing cautionary notes about this reaction. Experimental ignition testing of NO systems was conducted by Fauske & Associates, which showed no combustion unless ignition energy greater than 3 J was used. This exceeds the energy typical of a static discharge, so it does not fully explain the observed combustion. Further analysis of the reaction headspace using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that N2O was formed over time from a simple model system of NO + sodium methoxide + methanol. The conversion of NO to N2O and concomitant oxidation of methanol to formic acid proceeds to 50% in about six hours. Testing showed the energy needed to ignite the headspace of methanol under 1 bar of 50/50 NO/N2O is less than 3 mJ, several orders of magnitude lower than for similar systems without N2O. On the basis of these results, the likely cause of the explosions is the combination of (a) formation of N2O gas and (b) generation of static potential caused by the rapid flow of gas and condensing methanol through the Teflon-lined tubing during rapid depressurization (while venting), which leads to sparking of sufficient energy to cause the combustible vapor to ignite.  We wanted to alert the chemical process industry to risks associated with this particular procedure. Anyone contemplating use of this chemistry should thoroughly evaluate its safety. \" (reprint of full text)",

It is also used as dehydrator of natural gas; fuel for utility plants (methyl fuel); feedstock for manufacture of synthetic proteins by continuous fermentation; source of hydrogen for fuel cells, home-heating-oil extender. HUMAN STUDIES: Humans (and non-human primates) are uniquely sensitive to methanol poisoning. Nearly all of the available information on methanol toxicity in humans relates to the consequences of acute rather than chronic exposures. A vast majority of poisonings involving methanol have occurred from drinking adulterated beverages and from methanol-containing products. The minimum lethal dose of methanol in the absence of medical treatment is between 0.3 and 1 g/kg. Wide interindividual variability of the toxic dose is a prominent feature in acute methanol poisoning. Two important determinants of human susceptibility to methanol toxicity appear to be (1) concurrent ingestion of ethanol, which slows the entrance of methanol into the metabolic pathway, and (2) hepatic folate status, which governs the rate of formate detoxification. The symptoms and signs of methanol poisoning, which may not appear until after an asymptomatic period include visual disturbances, nausea, abdominal and muscle pain, dizziness, weakness and disturbances of consciousness ranging from coma to clonic seizures. Visual disturbances range from mild photophobia and misty or blurred vision to markedly reduced visual acuity and complete blindness. In extreme cases death results. The principal clinical feature is severe metabolic acidosis of the anion-gap type. ANIMAL STUDIES: The rate of metabolic detoxification, or removal of formate is vastly different between rodents and primates and is the basis for the dramatic differences in methanol toxicity observed between rodents and primates. The acute and short term toxicity of methanol varies greatly between different species, toxicity being highest in species with a relatively poor ability to metabolize formate. In such cases of poor metabolism of formate, fatal methanol poisoning occurs as a result of metabolic acidosis and neuronal toxicity, whereas, in animals that readily metabolize formate, consequences of CNS depression (coma, respiratory failure) are usually the cause of death. Overall methanol has a low acute toxicity to non-primate animals. In the rabbit, methanol is a moderate irritant to the eye. It was not skin sensitizing. The association between methanol exposure and lymphoma in some animal studies is weak, and is better interpreted as due to confounding factors or to a mechanism not relevant in humans. The inhalation of methanol by pregnant rodents throughout the period of embryogenesis induces a wide range of concentration-dependent teratogenic and embryolethal effects. Treatment-related malformations, primarily extra or rudimentary cervical ribs and urinary or cardiovascular defects, were found in fetuses of rats. Increased incidences of exencephaly and cleft palate were found in the offspring of mice. No increase in micronuclei was observed in the bone marrow of mice exposed to methanol. Methanol did not induce micronuclei in Chinese hamster lung V79 cells in vitro. Methanol was mutagenic in the mouse lymphoma assay, in a Basc test, or in Drosophila, sex-linked, recessive lethal mutation assay. Treatment of primary cultures of Syrian golden hamster embryo cells with methanol did not lead to cell transformation. Methanol was not mutagenic to Salmonella strains TA97, TA98, TA1535, TA 1537, and TA1538 in Ames tests with or without metabolic activation. Equivocal results were obtained with Salmonella strain TA102 in the presence of metabolic activation. Methanol was not mutagenic in a DNA-repair test using various strains of E. coli WP2 and in a forward mutation assay using Schizosaccharomyces pombe. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES:  Methanol is of low toxicity to aquatic organisms, and effects due to environmental exposure to methanol are unlikely to be observed, except in the case of a spill.",

This includes methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol. Methanol is among the most dangerous toxic alcohols, potentially producing significant morbidity and mortality in heavily exposed individuals who are left untreated. It is found in various household and industrial agents, and methanol poisoning may be due to accidental or intentional ingestions. Accidental poisonings have been due to distillation and fermentation errors, and as the result of beverage contamination. Examples of products that contain methanol include windshield wiper fluid, industrial solvents, some types of antifreeze, carburetor cleaner, etc. The exposures to methanol can cause varying degrees of toxicity and the management strategies range from close laboratory monitoring to antidotal therapy and dialysis. The primary treatment is fomepizole, and ethanol may be administered if fomepizole is not an option.",

In mammals, methanol is considered a poison because the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) converts methanol into ... formaldehyde /and other products/. However, the detection of methanol in the blood and exhaled air of healthy volunteers suggests that methanol may be a chemical with specific functions rather than a metabolic waste product. Using a genome-wide analysis of the mouse brain, we demonstrated that an increase in blood methanol concentration led to a change in the accumulation of mRNAs from genes primarily involved in detoxification processes and regulation of the alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenases gene cluster. To test the role of ADH in the maintenance of low methanol concentration in the plasma, we used the specific ADH inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) and showed that intraperitoneal administration of 4-MP resulted in a significant increase in the plasma methanol, ethanol and formaldehyde concentrations. Removal of the intestine significantly decreased the rate of methanol addition to the plasma and suggested that the gut flora may be involved in the endogenous production of methanol. ADH in the liver was identified as the main enzyme for metabolizing methanol because an increase in the methanol and ethanol contents in the liver homogenate was observed after 4-MP administration into the portal vein. Liver mRNA quantification showed changes in the accumulation of mRNAs from genes involved in cell signaling and detoxification processes. We hypothesized that endogenous methanol acts as a regulator of homeostasis by controlling the mRNA synthesis.",

While methanol metabolism and toxicology have been best studied in peripheral organs, little study has focused on the brain and no study has reported experimental evidence that demonstrates transformation of methanol into FA in the primate brain. In this study, three rhesus macaques were given a single intracerebroventricular injection of methanol to investigate whether a metabolic process of methanol to FA occurs in nonhuman primate brain. Levels of FA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were then assessed at different time points. A significant increase of FA levels was found at the 18th hour following a methanol injection. Moreover, the FA level returned to a normal physiological level at the 30th hour after the injection. These findings provide direct evidence that methanol is oxidized to FA in nonhuman primate brain and that a portion of the FA generated is released out of the brain cells. This study suggests that FA is produced from methanol metabolic processes in the nonhuman primate brain and that FA may play a significant role in methanol neurotoxicology.",

Our previous results showed that cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) were associated with methanol detoxification in the larvae. Catalases, alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), esterases (ESTs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) were specifically inhibited by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP) and diethylmeleate (DEM), respectively. CYPs were inhibited by piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and 1-aminobenzotriazole (1-ABT). In the present paper, the involvements of these enzymes in methanol metabolism were investigated in female and male adults by determining the combination indices of methanol and their corresponding inhibitors. When PBO, 1-ABT, 3-AT, 4-MP and TPP were individually mixed with methanol, they exhibited significant synergism to the mortality of the adults after 72 hr of dietary exposure. In contrast, the DEM and methanol mixture showed additive effects. Moreover, methanol exposure dramatically increased CYP activity and up-regulated mRNA expression levels of several Cyp genes. Bioassays using different strains revealed that the variation in ADH activity and RNAi-mediated knockdown of alpha-Est7 significantly changed LC50 values for methanol. These results suggest that CYPs, catalases, ADHs and ESTs are partially responsible for methanol elimination in adults. It seems that there are some differences in methanol metabolism between larvae and adults, but not between female and male adults.",

In the second step, formaldehyde is oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to formic acid or formate depending on the pH. In the third step, formic acid is detoxified by a folate-dependent pathway to carbon dioxide. Elimination of methanol from the blood appears to be slow in all species, especially when compared to ethanol. In humans, urinary methanol concentrations have been found to be proportional to the concentration of methanol in blood.",

It is noted that the most severe toxicity occurs many hours following peak blood and tissue methanol concentrations so that these do not necessarily provide an accurate indication of toxicity. Individual differences are seen both in this latent period and in individual susceptibility to methanol. This susceptibility may depend on the activity of folic acid requiring metabolic reactions involved in formate metabolism, formate being an intermediate produced during methanol oxidation and responsible for many toxic effects of methanol. Studies of the characteristics of methanol poisoning in non-primates and monkeys are examined. Despite the ingestion of lethal doses of methanol, non-primates generally do not develop significant metabolic acidosis nor impairment of vision, and no consistent histopathology has been demonstrated in these species. In monkeys, results suggest that the latent period represents a period of compensated metabolic acidosis; when compensatory mechanisms are exhausted, blood pH begins to drop. Formate accumulates and produces acidosis in the methanol poisoned monkey, but not in the rat, apparently due to a slower rate of formate metabolism to carbon dioxide in the monkey. ... Studies demonstrating the role of alcohol dehydrogenase in methanol metabolism in the monkey are reported; however, the catalase/peroxidative system which participates in methanol metabolism in rats apparently does not function in the monkey. Formaldehyde and formate metabolism are also examined. The regulation of the rate of formate metabolism is governed by regulation of the hepatic tetrahydrofolate concentrations. ... Further research is needed to determine what step or process it is which places the primate at a distinct liability in the metabolic disposition of one carbon moieties.",

The expression of methanol poisoning is related to the ability of an animal to metabolize formate to carbon dioxide. Since the rate of formate oxidation is related to hepatic tetrahydrofolate content and the activites of folate dependent enzymes, studies were designed to determine hepatic concentrations of hepatic tetrahydrofolate and activites of folate dependent enzymes of human liver and livers of species considered insensitive to methanol poisoning. An excellent correlation between hepatic tetrahydrofolate and maximal rates of formate oxidation has been observed. In human liver, levels were only 50% of those observed for rat liver and similar to those found in monkey liver. Total folate was also lower (60% decreased) in human liver than that found in rat or monkey liver. Interestingly, mouse liver contains much higher hepatic tetrahydrofolate and total folate than rat or monkey liver. This is consistent with higher formate oxidation rates in this species. A second important observation has been made. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity, the enzyme catalyzing the final step of formate oxidation to carbon dioxide, was markedly reduced in both monkey and human liver. Thus, two mechanisms may be operative in explaining low formate oxidation in species susceptible to methanol toxicity, low hepatic tetahydrofolate levels and reduced hepatic 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity.",

It has been shown in vitro to inhibit the activity of cytochrome oxidase, a vital component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain involved in ATP synthesis. Inhibition occurs subsequent to the binding of formic acid to the ferric heme iron of cytochrome oxidase, and the apparent inhibition constant is between 5 and 30 mM. Concentrations of formate present in the blood and tissues of methanol-intoxicated humans, non-human primates and rodent models of methanol-intoxication are within this range. Studies conducted in methanol-sensitive rodent models have revealed abnormalities in retinal and optic nerve function and morphology, consistent with the hypothesis that formate acts as a mitochondrial toxin. In these animal models, formate oxidation is selectively inhibited by dietary or chemical depletion of folate coenzymes, thus allowing formate to accumulate to toxic concentrations following methanol administration. Methanol-intoxicated rats developed formic acidemia, metabolic acidosis and visual toxicity analogous to the human methanol poisoning syndrome.",

Morphological studies, coupled with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry, revealed generalized retinal edema, photoreceptor and /retinal pigment epithelium/ (RPE) vacuolation, mitochondrial swelling and a reduction in cytochrome oxidase activity in photoreceptor mitochondria from methanol intoxicated rats. The most striking structural alterations observed in the retinas of methanol-intoxicated rats were vacuolation and mitochondrial swelling in inner segments of the photoreceptor cells. Photoreceptor mitochondria from methanol-intoxicated rats were swollen and expanded to disrupted cristae and showed no evidence of cytochrome oxidase reaction product. In contrast, photoreceptor mitochondria from control animals showed normal morphology with well-defined cristae and were moderately reactive for cytochrome oxidase reaction product. These findings are consistent with disruption of ionic homoeostasis in the photoreceptors, secondary to inhibition of mitochondrial function. Biochemical measurements also showed a significant reduction in retinal and brain cytochrome oxidase activity and ATP concentrations in methanol-intoxicated rats relative to control animals. Surprisingly, no differences from control values were observed in hepatic, renal or cardiac cytochrome oxidase activity or ATP concentrations in methanol-intoxicated rats. The reduction in retinal function, inhibition of retinal, optic nerve and brain cytochrome oxidase activity, depletion of retinal and brain ATP concentrations, and mitochondrial disruption produced in methanol-intoxicated rats are consistent with the hypothesis that formate acts as a mitochondrial toxin with selectivity for the retina and brain.",

Coma, respiratory failure, and death may ensue. [CHEMINFO] In high-dose reproductive studies in animals, methyl alcohol causes testicular damage and birth defects.

AEGLs are used by emergency responders when dealing with chemical spills or other catastrophic exposures.  AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

A fluorocarbon water foam can be applied to the spill to diminish vapor and fire hazard.

Leaking containers should be removed to the outdoors or to an isolated, well-ventilated area and the contents transferred to other suitable containers. The following materials are recommended for plugging leaks of methanol: polyester (eg Glad bag), imid polyester (eg brown-in-bag), stafoam urethane foam, sea-going epoxy putty, and MSA urethane.",
