When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

                      "String": "\"We would like to report an explosion that occurred in our laboratory last year while performing an oxidative coupling of trimethylsilylacetylene (TMSA) in a Glaser-Hay reaction. The explosion ruptured the 2-L reaction flask and seriously injured a researcher.  This reaction has been routinely used in our and many other laboratories to prepare 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne-1,3 on a large scale (>100 g), and no dangerous or unusual behavior was previously noted.  The procedure involves purging oxygen through a solution of TMSA in acetone in the presence of a copper(I) chloride:tetramethylethylenediamine complex catalyst at room temperature as described by Andrew B. Holmes et al. (Org. Syntheses 1993, Coll. Vol. 8, 63). The authors of the procedure recommend a safety shield as a general precaution while working with flammable materials in the atmosphere of oxygen, although no hazard was ever encountered. In this incident, the explosion occurred as soon as we started adding the solution of catalyst in acetone to the reaction. We have consulted with the pioneer of this reaction (Allan S. Hay) and the submitting author of the procedure (Holmes) and considered various scenarios to explain the explosion. Ignition of acetone/TMSA vapor by the external sources was hardly possible as the flask was well sealed and the outgoing gases were passed through a dry-ice condenser (lowering the vapor pressure below the explosive concentration) and brought to the back side of the fume hood through a 1-meter hose.  The reaction temperature (5 \u00baC) was noted by the researcher a few seconds before the explosion, thus ruling out unexpected reaction exothermy. The autoignition of the vapor on a hot stirring adapter (possibly heated by rotation-induced friction) was refuted, because joint lubrication was checked before setting up the experiment, and it would have required achieving an unrealistic temperature of greater than 300 \u00baC. Also, the explosion occurred upon adding the first few drops of copper catalyst, which makes crystallization of the explosive intermediate\u2014copper bis(trimethylsilylacetylide)\u2014highly improbable.  We speculate that a discharge of static electricity between the syringe needle and the digital thermometer inside the flask is the most likely cause of this explosion. A digital thermometer connected to a stirring hot plate (IKA) was used in the reaction, and a plastic syringe with a long metal needle was introduced through the same neck. An induced static voltage on the syringe through friction from handling (often observed in Montreal winter indoors while walking or even simply sitting) could then cause a sufficient differential potential on the needle for a discharge spark to occur close to the metallic body of the digital thermometer. The oxygen-rich atmosphere lowers the ignition energy and makes even a weak spark sufficient to cause a fire.  The incident emphasizes once more the potential danger of mixing oxygen gas with flammable solvents or reagents. More important, introducing two conductors into a flask brings a risk of static electricity discharge between the conductors, which is dangerous whenever a flammable solvent is used without inert gas. As wired metal-gauge digital thermometers are used more often in synthetic practice, precautions must be taken to avoid their contact with other metallic (conducting) parts inside the reaction flasks.\" (reprint of the full-text)",

It is a solvent for fats, oils, waxes, resins, rubber, plastics, lacquers, varnishes, rubber cements.  It is a versatile reagent in organic synthesis. Acetone is used in manufacturing of coatings, plastics, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. It is also used in production of other solvents and intermediates including: methyl isobutyl ketone, mesityl oxide, acetic acid (ketene process), diacetone alcohol, bisphenol A, methyl methacrylate, explosives, rayon, photographic films, isoprene. Acetone is not registered for current use in the U.S., but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. Acetone has been identified as being used in hydraulic fracturing as a corrosion inhibitor. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Acetone is relatively less toxic than many other industrial solvents; however, at high concentrations, acetone vapor can cause CNS depression, cardiorespiratory failure and death. In children 2 to 3 mL/kg is considered to be toxic. Acute exposures of humans to atmospheric concentrations have been reported to produce either no gross toxic effects or minor transient effects, such as eye irritation. More severe transient effects (including vomiting and fainting) were reported for workers exposed to acetone vapor concentrations for about 4 hr. Acute exposures to acetone have also been reported to alter performances in neurobehavioral tests in humans. Females were reported to suffer menstrual irregularities. Acetone also occurs as a metabolic component in blood, urine and human breath. Acetone is one of three ketone bodies that occur naturally throughout the body. It can be formed endogenously in the mammalian body from fatty acid oxidation. Fasting, diabetes mellitus and strenuous exercise increase endogenous generation of acetone. Under normal conditions, the production of ketone bodies occurs almost entirely within the liver and to a smaller extent in the lung and kidney. Products are excreted in the blood and transported to all tissues and organs of the body where they can be used as a source of energy. ANIMAL STUDIES: Oral LD50 values in adult rats are in the range of 5800-7138 mg/kg.  Mice were given 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, or 50,000 ppm acetone (females) and 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, or 20,000 ppm acetone  (males) via drinking water for 13 weeks. Absolute liver weight and liver weight to body weight ratios were significantly increased and absolute spleen weight and spleen weight to body weight ratios were significantly decreased in the females (50,000 ppm). In other experiments, rats were assessed for liver oxidative balance and lipid content after treatments with acetone in water for 28 days. Compared with controls, acetone-treated rats had increased hepatic GSH, hepatic vitamin E, glycemia, cholesterolemia, and hepatic fat, which is similar to the features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Acetone is not considered to be genotoxic or mutagenic. In a study of pregnant rats and mice exposed to acetone vapor during days 6-19 of gestation, slight developmental toxicity was observed. Reports of other reproductive effects of acetone include observations of testicular effects and changes of sperm quality in rats. Acetone has been used extensively as a solvent vehicle in skin carcinogenicity studies and is not considered carcinogenic when applied to the skin. The avoidance and escape behavior of female rats exposed to 3000, 6000, 12,000, or 16,000 ppm of acetone vapors for 10 days for 4 hr/day were studied. The 3000 ppm exposures had no effect on all exposure days, the 6000 ppm exposure initially inhibited the conditioned avoidance response but not the unconditioned escape response, and the two highest exposures inhibited both responses. Normal responses were obtained after three days of exposure to 6000 and 12,000 ppm, indicating that adaptive changes develop upon repeated exposure. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Acetone was tested with mallard eggs. Fertile eggs were immersed in 0, 10 or 100% acetone for 30 seconds at room temperature on days 3 or 8 of incubation. There were no significant effects with 10% acetone; however, 100% acetone caused a significant decrease in survival, embryonic weight and embryonic length for both exposure groups. It is unknown whether the mortality was due to the toxicity of acetone or to its solvent capabilities.",

Acetone may interfere with the composition of the membranes, altering their permeability to ions. Systemically, acetone is moderately toxic to the liver and produces hematological effects. The renal toxicity may be due to the metabolite, formate, which is known to be nephrotoxic and is excreted by the kidneys. One of the major effects of acetone is the potentiation of the toxicity of other chemicals. Pretreatment with acetone has been shown to potentiate the hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of carbon tetrachloride and chloroform by inducing particular forms of cytochrome P-450, especially cytochrome P-45OIIE1, and associated enzyme activities.

We attribute this to the washin-washout effect in the airways. The aim was to develop a PBTK-model that explains the behavior of acetone in blood and exhaled air at different levels of physical exercise. The model includes exchange of inhaled solvent vapor with the blood flow via the mucosa and separate compartments to describe working and resting muscles. The developed model was contrasted to a traditional PBTK-model where the conducting airways were regarded as an inert tube. Our model predictions agrees well with experimentally observed acetone levels in both arterial blood and end- and mixed-exhaled air from 26 inhalation experiments conducted with 18 human volunteers at 0, 50, 100 and 150 W workload. In contrast, the inert-tube model was unable to describe the data. The developed model is to our knowledge the first which explains the toxicokinetics of acetone at such various levels of physical exercise. It may be useful in breath monitoring and to obtain more accurate estimates of absorbed dose during inhalation of polar volatiles.",

The anticonvulsant mechanism of acetone is unknown, but it is metabolized to several bioactive substances that could play a role. Acetone and its major metabolites-acetol, 1,2-propanediol, methylglyoxal, and pyruvic acid-were assessed for anticonvulsant activity in two mouse seizure models. Various doses of the substances administered intraperitoneally were characterized for their ability to elevate the threshold for clonic seizures induced by intravenous infusion of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and for protection against tonic seizures induced by subcutaneous bolus administration of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). The inverted-screen test was used to assess acute neurological toxicity. Acetone (1-32 mmol/kg, i.p.), in a dose-dependent fashion, elevated the PTZ threshold and conferred protection against 4-AP seizures (ED(50), 26.3 mmol/kg). Effective doses of acetone (10-32 mmol/kg) did not cause motor impairment in the inverted-screen test (TD(50), 45.7 mmol/kg). In doses 10-fold greater than the minimally effective dose ofacetone (3.2 mmol/kg), the metabolites acetol, 1,2-propanediol, and pyruvic acid were inactive in the PTZ model. At higher doses that produced motor impairment, acetol and 1,2-propanediol (but not pyruvic acid) did elevate the PTZ threshold. Methylglyoxal had both proconvulsant and anticonvulsant actions, and had substantial toxicity, producing respiratory distress, motor impairment, and death. None of the acetone metabolites protected against 4-AP seizures. This study confirms the broad-spectrum anticonvulsant properties of acetone and indicates that the seizure protection conferred is unlikely to result from its major metabolic products.",

The methylglyoxal pathway is responsible for the conversion to acetol, acetol to methylglyoxal, & subsequent conversion of methylglyoxal to glucose. The propanediol pathway involves the conversion of acetol to L-1,2-propanediol by an as yet unknown process. L-1,2-propanediol is converted to L-lactaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase, & L-lactaldehyde is converted to L-lactic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Expression of these metabolic pathways in rat appears to be dependent on the induction of /acetone/ oxygenase & acetol monooxygenase by acetone.",

The primary (major) pathway involves hepatic metabolism of acetone to acetol and hepatic metabolism of acetol to methylglyoxal, while two secondary (minor) pathways are partially extrahepatic, involving the extrahepatic reduction of acetol to L-1,2-propanediol. Subsequent conversion of acetol to methylglyoxal in microsomes is catalyzed by acetol monooxygenase (also called acetol hydroxylase), an activity also associated with cytochrome P-450IIE1, and also requires oxygen and NADPH. Methylglyoxal can then be converted to D-glucose by an unidentified pathway, and/or possibly by catalysis by glyoxalase I and II and glutathione to D-lactate, which is converted to D-glucose. Some of exogenous acetone is unmetabolized and is excreted primarily in the expired air with little acetone excreted in urine. (N004)",

In a hospital patient who had ingested denatured alcohol, the elimination half-life (t(1/2)) of acetone during detoxification was 27 hr and not 3-5 hr as reported by other workers. Several other literature reports of individuals who had ingested isopropanol as well as controlled studies after administration of moderate amounts of acetone and/or isopropanol support the notion of a long elimination half-life of 17-27 hr for acetone compared with a t(1/2) of 1-3 hr for isopropanol.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

HBSLs were developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).",
