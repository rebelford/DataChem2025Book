PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

                          "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Benzene is a clear, colorless liquid with a sweet aromatic odor. It is used mainly as a starting material in manufacturing other chemicals, including detergents, pesticides, plastics and resins, synthetic rubber, aviation fuel, pharmaceuticals, dye, explosives, PCB gasoline, flavors and perfumes, paints and coatings, nylon intermediates, photographic chemicals. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Immediate signs and symptoms of exposure to benzene: People who breathe in high levels of benzene may develop drowsiness, dizziness, rapid or irregular heartbeat, headaches, tremors, confusion unconsciousness, death. Eating foods or drinking beverages containing high levels of benzene can cause vomiting, irritation of the stomach, dizziness, sleepiness, convulsions, rapid or irregular heartbeat, death. Long-term (a year or more) exposure to benzene causes harmful effects on the bone marrow, resulting in anemia and excessive bleeding. It can also affect the immune system, increasing the chance for infection. Some women who breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in the size of their ovaries. Acute deaths from benzene exposure at high concentrations have been due to ventricular fibrillation caused by exertion and release of epinephrine. Benzene causes cancer in humans. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 233 benzene factories and 83 control factories in 12 cities in China. The benzene cohort and the control cohort consisted of 28,460 benzene exposed workers and 28,257 control workers. The leukemia mortality rate was 14/100,000 person-years in the benzene cohort and 2/100,000 person-years in the control cohort. Most (76.6%) cases of benzene leukemia were of the acute type. The mortality due to benzene leukemia was high in organic synthesis plants followed by painting and rubber synthesis industries. The concentration of benzene to which patients with a leukemia were exposed ranged from 10 to 1000 mg/cu m (mostly from 50 to 500 mg/cu m). Benzene is genotoxic in humans: a significantly increased frequency of chromatid and isochromatid breaks in the cultured lymphocytes of exposed workers has been reported, as well as a significant increase of peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal aberrations. Metabolic activation of benzene by rat liver microsomes  induced sister chromatid exchanges and cell division delays in cultured human lymphocytes. Occupational exposure to benzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact. The general population may be exposed to benzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing benzene. ANIMAL TOXICITY STUDIES: Experimental animal studies, both inhalation and oral, also support the evidence that exposure to benzene increases the risk of cancer in multiple organ systems, including the hematopoietic system, oral and nasal cavities, liver, forestomach, preputial gland, lung, ovary, and mammary gland. Rats exposed to 3,526-8,224 ppm of benzene in a closed chamber for 15 minutes exhibited an increased number of ectopic ventricular beats. In developmental study, rats exposed to 10, 50, or 500 ppm (32, 160 & 1600 mg/cu m) of benzene for 7 hr/day had low incidence of brain and skeletal defects. Rats exposed continuously to 209.7 ppm for 10 days prior to breeding showed a complete absence of pregnancy. 1/10 rats exposed to 19.8 ppm had resorbed embryos. Genotoxicity studies have demonstrated the induction of chromosomal aberrations in bone-marrow cells from mice, rats, and rabbits treated with single or multiple daily doses of benzene ranging from about 0.2 to 2.0 mL/kg per day given either sc or ip. The major metabolites of benzene are phenol, hydroquinone, and catechol. The route of exposure has little effect on the subsequent metabolism of benzene to hemotoxic metabolites. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Young Coho salmon mortality was 12/20 at 50 ppm after 24 hr up to 96 hr and 30/30 at 100 ppm after 24 hr in artificial seawater at 8 \u00b0C. Herring and anchovy larvae studies showed that 35-45 ppm caused delay in development of eggs and produced abnormal larvae; 10-35 ppm caused delay in development of larvae, decrease in feeding  and growth, and increase in respiration. Blue crab juveniles when exposed to sublethal concentrations of benzene (0.1 or 5.0 ppm) in a static system showed an increase in the time needed to complete a molt cycle (50 days in case of benzene-exposed crab, as compared to 33 days for controls), a slower rate of growth of regenerating limb buds, and a depressed activity of ATPase in mitochrondria. Oxygen consumption by the crab decreased from exposure to 1.0 ppm benzene.",

Benzene's primary toxic effects are decreases in haematological cell counts and bone marrow cellularity. The decrease in blood cell count may be due to the binding of metabolites such as benzene oxide to the blood proteins albumin and haemoglobin. In the bone marrow, phenolic metabolites can be metabolized by bone marrow peroxidases to highly reactive semiquinone radicals and quinones that stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species. This and direct metabolite binding leads to damage to tubulin, histone proteins, and topoisomerase II. Some metabolites also exert mutagenic effects by inhibiting other DNA associated proteins, such as mitochondrial DNA polymerase and ribonucleotide reductase, as well as covalently binding to DNA itself, causing effects such as strand breakage, mitotic recombination, chromosome translocations, and aneuploidy.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Reproductive effects have been reported for women exposed by inhalation to high levels, and adverse effects on the developing fetus have been observed in animal tests.

After chronic exposure, it can cause aplastic anemia and leukemia. [ACGIH] Exposure to benzene has been associated with development of a particular type of leukemia called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). [ATSDR Public Health Statement: Benzene] There is sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of benzene. Benzene causes acute myeloid leukaemia/acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia. [IARC Monograph Volume 100F (2012)] The WHO classification of AML includes Acute erythroid leukemia and Acute monocytic leukemia. [www.cancer.org] Significant benzene exposure increases the risk of leukemia during the 10 years following exposure. Risk is not related to exposures that occurred greater than 20 years prior to the onset of disease. [PMID 10861761] The highest exposures (mean of 11 ppm) in petroleum refinery workers occur in disconnecting cargo loading hoses, and respiratory protection is required. [PMID 20941467] Workers exposed to products containing <0.1% benzene are not likely to be exposed above the TLV of 0.5 ppm.

Under the proposed revised Carcinogen Risk Asessment Guidelines (USEPA, 1996), benzene is characterized as a known human carcinogen for all routes of exposure based upon convincing human evidence as well as supporting evidence from animal studies. Epidemiologic studies and case studies provide clear evidence of a causal association between exposure to benzene and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and also suggest evidence for chronic nonlymphocytic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Other neoplastic conditions that are associated with an increased risk in humans are hematologic neoplasms, blood disorders such as preleukemia and aplastic anemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. These human data are supported by animal studies. The experimental animal data add to the argument that exposure to benzene increases the risk of cancer in multiple species at multiple organ sites (hematopoietic, oral and nasal, liver, forestomach, preputial gland, lung, ovary, and mammary gland). It is likely that these responses are due to interactions of the metabolites of benzene with DNA ... Recent evidence supports the viewpoint that there are likely multiple mechanistic pathways leading to cancer and, in particular, to leukemogenesis from exposure to benzene. HUMAN CARCINOGENICITY DATA: Benzene is a known human carcinogen based upon evidence presented in numerous occupational epidemiological studies. Significantly increased risks of leukemia, chiefly acute myelogenous leukemia, have been reported in benzene-exposed workers in the chemical industry, shoemaking and oil refineries. ANIMAL CARCINOGENICITY DATA:... many experimental animal studies, both inhalation and oral, also support the evidence that exposure to benzene increases the risk of cancer in multiple organ systems, including the hematopoietic system, oral and nasal cavities, liver, forestomach, preputial gland, lung, ovary, and mammary gland ....",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).

Repeated or prolonged skin contact with liquid benzene can remove the natural oils from the skin, causing it to crack and peel. Repeated exposure to levels of benzene below 200 ppm may cause chronic CNS effects (headache, drowsiness, and nervousness). Chronic benzene exposure in the workplace has been associated with blood (hematologic) disorders, such as low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), absence of red blood cells (aplastic anemia), and loss of all types of blood cells due to bone marrow damage.",
