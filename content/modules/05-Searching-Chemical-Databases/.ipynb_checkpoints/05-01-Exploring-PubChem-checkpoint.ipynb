    "The [PubChem homepage](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) provides a unified search interface that allows users to explore an extensive set of interrelated chemical and biological databases.

    "## PubChem as a Data Aggregator\n",
    "The public often has a misconception of PubChem as a data validator. PubChem is really a data aggregator and as of July 2025 there are over 1,063 sources, including government agencies, university labs, pharmaceutical companies, substance vendors, and other databases. An up-to-date list of PubChem’s data sources is available at the [PubChem Sources page](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sources). When a source contributes data it is stored as a substance or bioassay data record and assigned an substance ID (SID) or assay ID (or AID).  PubChem than uses a canonicalization technique to associate the SID with a specific chemical structure and uses that structure to associate the substance record with a compound record. So the compound record is the aggregation of the substance records uploaded from multiple data sources for a specific compound, and so doing it maintains the data provenance by linking back to the original Substance record and depositors information. If an uploaded bioassay has an associated SID, it is then connected to the compound record of the compound that SID is associated with. See the PubChem document: [What is the difference between a substance and a compound in PubChem?](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/compound-vs-substance)\n",

    "NIH Entrez (French for \"Enter\") is the search and retrieval system of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It is essentially an integrated search engine for accessing a wide range of interconnected databases hosted by NCBI, of which PubChem is one. Entrez is integrated throughout NCBI resources and can be accessed through the search bar on top of the NCBI landing page [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)\n",

    "The [Entrez Help NCBI Help Manual](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3837/#EntrezHelp.Access_to_the_Entrez_System) is a 20 minute read that goes over the Entrez Databases, how to access and search them.  A complete list of Entrez resources can be found at the [All Resources link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/all/). PubChem's home page is a \"unified chemical search interface\" that covers all three of PubChem's primary databases (Substance, Compound and BioAssay) and supports searches using molecular formula, and line notations like SMILES and InChIs. There is an option for text searches within Entrez from the PubChem homepage and more information is available in the [Entrez Advanced Search](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/advanced-search-entrez) option.\n",
